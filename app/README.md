- 🖼️ High-resolution image downloading with duplicate prevention
- 📊 SQLite database integration for product data storage
- 🚦 Rate limiting and polite scraping practices
- 📝 Comprehensive logging system

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]

2. Install required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure your database path in `scrape_fireworks.py`:
   engine = create_engine('sqlite:///fireworks.db')

## Configuration

The project uses `websites.yaml` for website configurations. Each website entry includes:

    name: Website Name
    url: https://website-url.com
    scraper: scraper_file.py
    enabled: true
    limit: 5  # Number of images to download (-1 for unlimited)
    note: "Website-specific notes and structure information"

## Usage

Run the scraper:
    python scrape_fireworks.py

The scraper will:
1. Load configurations from `websites.yaml`
2. Process each enabled website
3. Download images to site-specific folders
4. Store product metadata in the database
5. Generate detailed logs in `scraper.log`
